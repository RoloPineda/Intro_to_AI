    "Artificial Intelligence might sound scary to some (it certainly makes some great headlines - ['Can Humans Be Replaced by Machines?,'](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/books/review/genius-makers-cade-metz-futureproof-kevin-roose.html) but at the very core, AI is all mathematics and programming. <br>According to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment.'\n",

    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data. ML is different than regular programming because they aim to solve problems in a different way. Imagine you are told to create a program that identifies cats. In a conventional programming approach, you might create a program and define classes or functions that define clearly what a cat is. For example, you might define a class that checks to see if the image has a tail, whiskers, eyes, four legs, and a nose, then your program would check if all those elements are found within the image, and if so, it would assert that it's a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning approaches this task a little different. With ML, you might collect a lot of images of cats and label them as cats, then create a model that goes over every image and it would derive from it certain features that it thinks it's a cat. Then, it would predict whether a certain image has those features that make up a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big difference is that in regular programming, you define the rules and explicitly program them. With Machine Learning, those rules are derived from data and examples."

    "### What are Neural Networks?\n",
    "NN are a technique for building a computer program that learns from data. It is based very loosely on how we think the human brain works. First, a collection of software “neurons” are created and connected together, allowing them to send messages to each other. Next, the network is asked to solve a problem, which it attempts to do over and over, each time strengthening the connections that lead to success and diminishing those that lead to failure.\n",

    "\n",
    "A way to think of this image is that the input layer neurons are essentially those examples you collected of cats, and the output layer are the labels that say if that image is a cat or not."

    "\n",
    "First, let's understand what the code *loss='mean_squared_error'* is doing. This code is just telling our model that the loss function we are using is [mean squared error](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/mean-squared-error-mse/). A loss function tells a ML model how wrong a prediction is. There are several ways of calculating the error but for now, it's enough to know that the formula for this loss function is:\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- yi is the ith observed value.\n",
    "- ŷi is the corresponding predicted value.\n",
    "- n = the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of ML is to minimize that value, or in other words, to get as accurate as it can. Typically, ML models accomplish that by tweaking parameters, and the way they do it is by using an Optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate what these two things are doing, imagine you are dropped in the middle of California and your task is to get to the beach. Since you can't really tell where you are, you decide to just start walking in any direction until you see a landmark or something that tells you what direction you are heading. As you walk, you start seeing signs that point to the beach. So you adjust your route until you get to the beach.\n",
    " That's essentially what a ML model does. It starts walking (or making predictions) towards the beach and the loss function tells it whether it's going in the right direction or not, and then the optimizer makes sure that the next time the model makes a prediction, the parameters it used to make a prediction are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code *tf.keras.optimizers.Adam* is the way we access the optimizers API from keras. In this case, we will be using [Adam](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Adam) as our optimizer.\n"
